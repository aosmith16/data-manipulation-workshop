# Data manipulation in R workshop

An introduction to data manipulation in R via **dplyr** and **tidyr**.

This two-hour workshop is aimed at graduate students who have been introduced to R in statistics classes but haven’t had any training on how to work with data in R. 

The workshop covers how to:

- Make data summaries by group  
- Filter out rows  
- Select specific columns  
- Add new variables  
- Change the format of datasets (i.e., *reshape* datasets)  
- Join datasets together  

Along the way students learn how to use the pipe operator to chain several data manipulation steps together. Students have time to practice data manipulation and reshaping using the `babynames` dataset from package **babynames**.

I provide an R script that we'll run code from during the workshop as well as  a PDF document.  The PDF is a written version of the workshop, including code and output, to be used as a reference.
